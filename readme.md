Description

A videogame based off "Faith: The Holy Trinity".

After reciving a distressed note, Father John known for his 'intense' demon exorcision methods, drives out to deal with the problem, once and for all.

## Implementation

-sprint, camera bob, jumping
-storyline, voice acting (AI, https://imrane03.github.io/better-sam/)
-combat with animations!
-animated enemies
-procedural generation
-dialogue
-atmospheric enviroments

## What Makes this a Game?

competence: via combat, and the motivation of resolving the story and conflict, this pushes the player to complete the game

automy: while the gameplay is fairly linear, there is some option of choice for the maze to get through it

relatedness: It may be slightly hard to relate directly to the profession of a demon-hunting preist in 80s, you can relate to wanting to help people, especially those in danger, and I hope that the motivation to protect the people of a small town is motivation enough to want to play a game, also the horror aspect.
